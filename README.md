UI Assignment for Assessment

# UI Developer Assessment

Integrated with modern technologies using React, with an old codebase that uses MooTools- Could not achieve the communication between React and Mootools do re-wrote the old component in React.

Deep knowledge of MooTools is not necessary to complete this assignment, but knowledge of similar libraries from the same era (like JQuery) will help.

## Assignment

The index.html page has code that renders a very simple MooTools-based web component with 3 buttons and a div. When the buttons are clicked, they update a div's text.

The main goal is to build a modern UI component and render it in the `id="new"` div., it should do the following:

1. Update when any of the buttons on the old component are clicked
2. Have a button of it's own that when clicked updates something in the old component (bi-directional communication), using object oriented programming
3. Add a second React component to the page, it's functionality is up to you - Added a Simple react Search Component

### Requirements

1. Complete the main goal using React and TypeScript - `Completed Using react and re-write the mootool component in React`
2. Provide a git repository with your solution using a link to a publicly accessible repository -`Done`
3. Changes to index.html should be minimal: it is a proxy for one of the many pages in our platform - `Implemented a approach to create a communication between mootool component and React Component, not able to resolve all the errors`
4. Changes to the existing JavaScript are allowed but should be minimal to accomplish the assignment. `WebComponent.js` should not be changed
5. Use the git commit history to show progress and your thought process - `Done`

#### Extra credit

If time allows, add unit testing to the new React code - `Could not achieve this task` .

## Delivery

1. Create a new repository with the initial code and build your solution on top of it
2. Add a README-IMPLEMENTED.md with any details necessary
3. Once the solution is built, send your solution to your hiring contact
4. Please deliver the solution within 14 days of receiving this assessment
